## Project Overview

I am thrilled to present my latest project featuring the beloved Disney character, Doraemon. This web page is created entirely using HTML and CSS, showcasing my skills in front-end development.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Leveraged extensively, including the `position` property to manage layout and design effectively.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the web page adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implemented user-friendly features to enhance the browsing experience.
- **CSS Positioning**: The `position` property played a pivotal role in achieving precise element placement and layout control.

## Future Enhancements

I plan to expand this project by incorporating JavaScript functionality for dynamic interactions and possibly integrating backend technologies for more advanced features.

## How to Use

Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your preferred browser to explore the Doraemon-themed web page!
